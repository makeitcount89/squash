  <h1>Privacy Policy for QR: Free Scanner</h1>

  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 26, 2023</p>

  <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Make It Count Apps</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Make It Count Apps ("us," "we," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application, QR: Free Scanner ("the App"), collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards your information when you use our mobile application.
  </p>

  <p>
    By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to the terms and practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our practices, please do not use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>2.1 Personal Information</strong></p>
  <p>
    We do not collect any personally identifiable information from you while using the App.
  </p>

  <p><strong>2.2 Non-Personal Information</strong></p>
  <p>
    We may collect non-personal information, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect information about your mobile device, including its model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about how you use the App, such as the features you access, the duration of your usage, and any error reports generated by the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Display of Personalized Ads</h2>
  <p>
    The App may display personalized ads from Google AdMob. Google AdMob collects and uses user data, including your IP address, to serve relevant advertisements, bill advertisers for ad clicks, and detect fraudulent clicks. Please note that AdMob anonymizes the IP address after 9 months.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Financing through Personalized Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    In cases where we make our services available free of charge, we finance our services through personalized advertising. This allows us to provide the App to you at no cost while maintaining its functionality and features.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Following Links from QR Codes</h2>
  <p>
    QR codes may contain links that, when followed, could lead to websites or content that collect user information. Please be aware that these websites and their practices are not our responsibility. We recommend exercising caution and reviewing the privacy policies of such websites when following QR code links.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Communication via Email</h2>
  <p>
    Users may choose to send us an email either directly or using forms within the apps. Personal data transmitted via email will be stored for the purpose of processing the conversation. In this context, the data will not be disclosed to third parties. It's important to note that this data is used exclusively for the intended conversation. Once the purpose of collecting this data has been fulfilled, which typically occurs when the conversation with the user has concluded or when it is evident that the subject matter has been addressed, the data will be deleted. We respect your privacy and ensure that your personal data is handled with care in the course of these communications.
